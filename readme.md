# Python Utils

This repo contains a script with a series useful functions for data processing in Python:

* `fix_names()`: This function takes a list of column names and standardizes the names
 for Python analysis returning a list of fixed names.

 * `break_string`: Take one string and break it into a list of elements given the spaces inside the string.
